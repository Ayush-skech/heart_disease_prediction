#### Heart Disease Risk Prediction
This project is an interactive web application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health parameters.
Built with Streamlit, XGBoost, and SHAP, it not only delivers accurate predictions but also explains them in a clear, visual way.

Users can enter details like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more to instantly see:

Risk probability of heart disease

Key contributing factors for the prediction (via SHAP values)

Easy-to-understand charts and explanations

The goal is to combine machine learning accuracy with transparency, helping users and healthcare professionals make more informed decisions.
